# Serverless AWS CSV Data Pipeline with S3, Lambda  pandas, and Amazon QuickSight 

A serverless AWS data pipeline that processes and cleans **CSV** files using **Lambda** and **pandas**, with secure **S3** access through **IAM roles** and lightweight deployment via **Lambda Layers**.

The processed CSV data is stored back in S3 and is ready for visualization in **Power BI** or **Amazon QuickSight**, enabling quick and flexible business insights.

---

## Example Use Case

Imagine a SaaS company tracking product sales across multiple countries.  
Raw CSVs uploaded to S3 often contain missing prices, inconsistent symbols like `$`, or text-based numbers.  
This pipeline automatically cleans that data and makes it ready for visualization.

## 🔑 IAM Role Setup
**Create Role & Attach**  
   - **AmazonS3FullAccess** (or limited access to your specific bucket)
   - **CloudWatchLogsFullAccess** (for monitoring Lambda logs)

---

## 📁 Project Workflow Steps

1. **User Uploads CSV**
   - The user uploads a CSV file to the **Raw CSV S3 bucket**.

2. **Trigger Lambda Function**
   - The S3 upload event triggers an **AWS Lambda** function.

3. **Lambda Layer Setup for pandas**
   -  Use Prebuilt **Klayers**
   ex: ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region, use this ARN: 
   arn:aws:lambda:ap-south-1:770693421928:layer:Klayers-p313-pandas:1

4. **Process and Save CSV**
   - The Lambda function reads the uploaded CSV, processes it (cleaning, filtering, formatting), and saves the processed output to the **Processed-CSV bucket**.

5. **Log and Monitor**
   - All events and execution details are logged in **Amazon CloudWatch** for monitoring.

6. **Error Handling**
   - If an error occurs, a **failure notification** is sent using AWS monitoring tool **SNS**.

7. **Data Visualization**
   - **Amazon QuickSight** reads the processed CSV from the S3 bucket and displays it in an interactive **dashboard** for analytics and reporting.
